The code used to run simulations for the paper titled  A robust in vivo-like persistent firing supported by a hybrid of intracellular and synaptic mechanisms, published in PLOS: ONE. Authored by Arthur Jochems and Motoharu Yoshida.

Instructions:

(1) Execute one of the main files (e.g. Main - Fig1F.hoc).

(2) Find the "Test panel" window and click "Run Complete experiment" button. ( Do not use "Init&Run" button from "RunControl"). This should run the simulation.
